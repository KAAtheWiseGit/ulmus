# Ulmus

Ulmus is a TUI framework, inspired by [Charm's][charm] [Bubble Tea][bt].
Like Bubble Tea, it uses the [Elm architecture][ea].


## Architecture

To use Ulmus a user needs to create a type which implements the [`Model`
trait][Model].  It will be called using a [`Program`], via the [`run`]
method.

`Program` will repeatedly call the model, passing crossterm messages via
model's [`update` method][update].  After each update the [`view`]
method will be called, and the results will be draw on the terminal.

For performing I/O see [`Command`] and [`Subroutine`].


## [Examples]

- [Inline picker][examples-ip] â€” a TODO list picker which uses the
  inline `Program` mode.


## Comparison

### Bubble Tea

Ulmus interface is based on that of Bubble Tea, so they are very
similar.  The model is mutated in-place in `update`, since it can be
ensured that it doesn't change when `view` is called.


### [Ratatui]

- Ratatui is a library.  The application calls Ratatui's functions.

- Ulmus is a framework.  Ulmus calls application's code.

Additionally, Ulmus does less than Ratatui.  It doesn't support multiple
terminal backends, styling (the application has to do it itself, for
example using [`colored`]), or complex widgets (Ratatui renders each
cell individually, Ulmus renders one string).

Finally, Ratatui is a mature project with a [large ecosystem][re] and
Ulmus is my small weekend project.
